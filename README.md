Girl Child Education in Africa – Data Analytics Project
📊 A Data-Driven Analysis of Gender Gaps, Child Marriage, and Educational Inequality Across Africa

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes gender disparities in education across African countries using multiple datasets covering:

Child marriage rates (girls vs boys)

Out-of-school rates

School completion rates

Gender parity

Women empowerment indicators

The goal is to uncover how gender inequality, child marriage, and socioeconomic factors affect girls’ access to education, and how these insights align with findings from UNICEF and USAID.

This work also forms part of a women empowerment initiative aimed at supporting girls in underserved African communities.

🎯 Objectives

Measure gender gaps in education outcomes across African regions.

Analyze the impact of child marriage on girls’ access to schooling.

Identify countries with highest educational inequality.

Visualize the relationship between:

Poverty and schooling

Rural/urban residence

Child marriage and education

Provide insights aligned with UNICEF and USAID reports.

Advocate for policies and interventions that strengthen girl child education.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI (Dashboard visuals)

Excel (Data cleaning and preprocessing)

SQL (MySQL) – database storage (gender_parity_africa)

Python (optional) for further analysis

📂 Dataset Sources

The project uses cleaned datasets derived from:

Child Marriage (Girls vs Boys)

Out-of-School Rate (Gender + Rural/Urban + Wealth)

Completion Rate (Primary & Secondary)

Women Empowerment Index

Gender Parity Indicators

All datasets were combined, cleaned, and transformed for Power BI use.

📌 Key Insights
1. Child Marriage (Girls vs Boys) – Alignment with UNICEF & USAID

chart shows:

Girls face extremely higher child marriage rates than boys.

In some African countries (CAR, Chad, Mali), over 50–60% of girls are married by age 18.

Boys’ early marriage remains below 10% in most cases.

This aligns directly with UNICEF and USAID findings:

UNICEF reports that most of the world’s 120 million out-of-school children are girls, and early marriage is a major cause.

USAID reports that 98 million girls are out of school and 1 in 7 girls is married before age 15.

graph visually confirms:

➡️ Child marriage is overwhelmingly a girls’ issue, not a boys’ issue.
➡️ Majority of marriages happen between ages 15–18, matching UNICEF’s global child marriage curve.

2. Education Outcomes

Countries with high child marriage rates also have low secondary completion rates for girls.

Rural girls remain significantly disadvantaged vs urban girls.

Wealth strongly influences access — poorest girls are 3–5× more likely to be out of school.

3. Gender Parity & Empowerment

Countries with higher gender parity tend to have:

Higher completion rates for girls

Lower out-of-school rates

Lower child marriage prevalence

Example:
South Africa & Rwanda consistently show better gender equity.

🧠 Why This Matters

Educated girls are more likely to:

Delay marriage

Earn higher income

Avoid poverty

Raise healthier families

Become leaders in their communities

This project supports ongoing advocacy for women empowerment and girls’ education across Africa.
